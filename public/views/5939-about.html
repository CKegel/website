            <p class="lead text-justify">RPI Ambulance operates a 2006 AEV Trauma Hawk XL Type II ambulance mounted on a Ford E-350
                chassis. This vehicle was placed in service in the Spring of 2007. The county vehicle identifier is
                5939, however the ambulance was formerly known as A-39 and continues to hold this call sign within the
                agency. 5939 is the fifth van ambulance operated by RPI Ambulance. The first was placed in service in
                1983.</p>

                <p class="lead">In Spring 2007, 5939 was delivered to replace the aging A-39. A-39 had proudly served
                    the agency for 10 years before being retired. The agency has also operated several other ambulances,
                    the first of which was a [INSERT DATA] that was given to RPI Ambulance when members saved a member
                    of the faculty from choking in one of the dining halls.</p>
